## Download

On Bookshelves, you can download books, comics and audiobooks. A movie can be downloaded directly from the movie page but for TV shows, you need to go to the season page and download each episode. Be reasonable and download only what you need to avoid overloading the bandwidth you share with other users.

If you encounter an error, if you don't understand any aspect of the platform or if you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to use the [bug report form](/bug-form).

If you're interested in a movie or TV shows that isn't on the platform, please use the [ask form](/ask-form). Of course, if you'd like a movie (or TV shows) that's already available to be offered in better quality (maximum limit 1080p) or in a different language, the same form can be used.

## Read file

Bookshelves files use often the `.mkv` extension. This is a container format that can hold multiple video and audio tracks, subtitles and metadata. It is a free and open standard, so it is widely supported on all platforms.

To read `.mkv` files, you can use different software:

-   [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/) : VLC is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player and framework that plays most multimedia files as well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols. _For Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS and more._
-   [IINA](https://iina.io/) : The modern media player for macOS. _For macOS only._

Of course, you can use advanced software like [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) to manage your media library.

## Quality

All movies and TV shows available on Bookshelves aren't available in the same quality. The quality depends on the source of the file. The best quality is 4K. The worst quality is 720p. The quality is indicated on the movie or TV shows episode page into **Metadata** and with a badge on the movie or TV shows episode card.

## Compression

A media file can be compressed to reduce its size. Bookshelves use the [HEVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) codec and the [AVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding) codec to compress files. The compression is indicated on the movie or TV shows episode page into **Metadata** and with a badge on the movie or TV shows episode card.

Best compression is HEVC, but AVC is more compatible with old devices.

## Audio tracks

Bookshelves offers audio tracks in different audio languages directly embedded in the video file. You can activate them in your video player.

To know if a movie or TV shows has audio tracks, you can check the audio section on the movie or TV shows episode page into **Metadata**.

## Subtitle tracks

Bookshelves offers subtitles in different languages directly embedded in the video file. You can activate them in your video player. If you want to download subtitles separately, you can use [Subscene](https://subscene.com/) or [OpenSubtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.org/).

To know if a movie or TV shows has subtitles, you can check the subtitles section on the movie or TV shows episode page into **Metadata**.

## Any questions?

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to use the [bug report form](/bug-form).

## Legal

You can download legally one movie or one TV show if you own the physical media support download. Of course, you can consider that if you download media that doesn't meet these criteria, it's simply a mistake on your part. So why not watch it now you've got it?

You can get a media with different methods:

-   Peer-to-peer sharing
-   Streaming
-   Direct download

The safe usage of Bookshelves depends on the rules in force in your country. Bookshelves works with a **direct download** system.
