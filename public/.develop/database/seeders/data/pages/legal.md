APP_NAME is not responsible for what you do with the files offered for download, you only have the right to download them if they are in the public domain and/or if you already own a legal copy of the file.

You cannot hold APP_NAME responsible for what you do with these files, and conversely, you own them. Of course, since APP_NAME is based on an open-source project, if pirated content is offered on this website, the developers of the original project cannot be held responsible.
